Data Relationships:
    A to-do can contain many sub-tasks, but a sub-task can only be assigned to one to-do 
    A topic can contain many to-dos, but a to-do can only be assigned to one topic
    If a to-do is created with no topic, then move it to the 'General' topic 

    The 'General' topic is immutable. To-dos can be added, but it itself cannot be updated nor deleted.
